# Ultra-Aroma-Mobile-Pest-Repellent

### Overview

This repository showcases the prototype and codebase for my patented invention — an **IoT and AI-driven pest management system**. The system combines **robotics, artificial intelligence, ultrasonic sensors, and organic pest repellent sprays** to autonomously detect and repel pests in real time.

Unlike conventional pest control devices, this system is designed for **smart, environment-friendly, and adaptive field monitoring**, ensuring minimal chemical use and maximum precision.
